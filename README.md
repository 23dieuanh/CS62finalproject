The README should include:

At minimum, how to run the code
If you are using external libraries, place the .jar files in a /lib folder and also commit them. Check out the Project Manager for Java VSCode extension to be able to import their classes and methods. If any external libraries need to be installed beyond their .jar files, please detail how to do so in the README.
Instructions on how to call your public methods: that is, an API. This could be the same thing as your JavaDocs: What is the method called? What are its inputs and outputs? What is a verbal description of what it does? Donâ€™t forget about constructors!
For each of your public methods, also include usage examples. What do expected inputs and outputs look like in practice? For example, a usage example for add(x,y) would be add(2, 3) = 5.
A one paragraph summary in the beginning on what your software does, ideally showing screenshots or examples of your code running.
Here is a guide on how to make and format a README. The formatting language of READMEs is Markdown.
Your repo, in addition to your code, should also contain your dataset file. If the dataset has sensitive information, please make a note of it in your PDF write up and submit it on Gradescope instead.

Please make sure your repository is public. Projects that have a repository I cannot access will receive a 0.
